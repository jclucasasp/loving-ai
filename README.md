# Loving AI

This React app connects to a Spring Boot backend. The complete app is to simulate a dating app using AI generated images and profiles. Each AI 'persona' has been configured to respond according to their age, ethnicity and a view other 'magic tricks' to make each one unique. Each 'persona' also have his/her own memory to make the conversation more relevant and fun. The model that was chosen is very engaging and simulate human conversation exceptionally well, especially after being 'tweaked' a bit.
